In this repository you will find a .html and .ipynp file. (I prefer a html file to take a quick look).

This Python code was developed at the end of a Machine Learning and Python course as final project. Firstly, we do a pre-processing data: cleaning, dropping duplicates data and keeping valued data. Then, we go on with a data visualization. At the end of the code, we use collaborative filtering, matrix and cosine similarity to predict unknown values of a user.
